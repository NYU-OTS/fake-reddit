# Objective
The project that gets me familiar with React, Redux and TypeScript (and webpack probably).

# What is this?
This is an app that attempts to simulates a very limited portion of the infamous website ```reddit.com```. While the final product most likely fail to resemble the looks, it shall demonstrate my familiarity in React, Redux and TS.

# Expectation
The demo app only has one "subreddit". User registration is public, but moderators are set by admin. An admin that has total control all users' actions and information except their login credentials. I think I am being too ambitious but we'll see.

# Stack
* Front: ```TypeScript```, ```React``` and ```Redux```
* Back: ```Firebase```

# How to run?
* Locally: ```cd app && yarn start``` or ```cd app && npm start```
* Remotely: Go to ```https://not-fake-reddit-at-all.firebaseapp.com```

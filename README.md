# Objective
The project that gets me familiar with React, Redux and TypeScript (and webpack probably).

# What the app does
It's an Admin interface that can create, edit and delete users. It's not very secure but it should demontstrate my understanding of React, Redux and TS.

# Stack
* Front: ```TypeScript```, ```React``` and ```Redux```
* Back: ```Firebase```

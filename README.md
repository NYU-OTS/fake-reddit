# Objective
The project that gets me familiar with React, Redux and TypeScript (and webpack probably).

# What is this?
This is an app that attempts to simulates a very limited portion of the infamous website ```reddit.com```. While the final product most likely fail to resemble the looks, it shall demonstrate my familiarity in React, Redux and TS.

# Expectation
I went off track and implemented a portion of Reddit. Performance is bad because I only had like a week.

# Stack
* Front: ```TypeScript```, ```React``` and ```Redux```
* Back: ```Firebase```

# How to run?
* Locally: ```cd app && && yarn && yarn start``` or ```cd app && npm install && npm start```
* Remotely: Go to ```https://not-fake-reddit-at-all.firebaseapp.com```
